## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on the detection and prediction of landslide vulnerability. The methodology leverages satellite-based remote sensing techniques, specifically Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR), in conjunction with a deep learning model (U-net) to analyze land deformation and predict potential landslide occurrences.

The project workflow involves:

1.  **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Utilizing Sentinel-1 satellite imagery and processing it with the SNAP (Sentinel Application Platform) tool to generate Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) through the DInSAR technique.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Deriving crucial features such as Slope (from DEM), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and utilizing natural color (RGB) imagery. ArcGIS Pro is employed for spatial analysis tasks like slope calculation and data clipping.
3.  **Model Training:** Training a U-net deep learning model using a prepared dataset containing DEM, Slope, NDVI, and RGB data to identify and segment areas susceptible to landslides.
4.  **Model Validation:** Validating the trained model using a specific landslide case study (SR-530 Oso landslide, WA, USA) to assess its prediction accuracy.

This repository aims to provide a clear and reproducible workflow for landslide vulnerability assessment using cutting-edge remote sensing and deep learning techniques.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, you will need to have the following installed:

1.  **Python 3.x:** Download from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2.  **Required Python Libraries:** Install the necessary libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python numpy matplotlib
    ```
3.  **SNAP (Sentinel Application Platform):** Download and install from [https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/tools/snap](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/tools/snap)
4.  **ArcGIS Pro:** Requires a license from Esri.
5.  **Optional: CUDA and cuDNN (for GPU acceleration):** If you have an NVIDIA GPU, installing CUDA and cuDNN can significantly speed up the model training process. Follow the TensorFlow documentation for installation instructions.

## Usage

The repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate the key steps of the project:

* **`Landslide detection.ipynb`:** This notebook likely covers the entire workflow, including:
    * Data loading and preprocessing of satellite imagery and derived features.
    * Implementation and training of the U-net model.
    * Evaluation of the trained model on a test dataset.
* **`LoadandPredict.ipynb`:** This notebook demonstrates how to load a pre-trained U-net model and use it to make predictions on new, unseen data. This could be used for the SR-530 landslide case study or other areas of interest.
* **`Presentation.ipynb`:** This notebook might contain visualizations, explanations, and results of the project, potentially structured as a presentation.

To run these notebooks:

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/07VK/Remote-Sensing-Landslide.git](https://github.com/07VK/Remote-Sensing-Landslide.git)
    cd Remote-Sensing-Landslide
    ```
2.  Ensure you have the necessary data files (satellite imagery, shapefiles, etc.) in the appropriate directories (these might be specified within the notebooks).
3.  Open the Jupyter Notebooks using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    # or
    jupyter notebook
    ```
4.  Follow the instructions and execute the cells within each notebook.

**Note:** Processing satellite data with SNAP and performing spatial analysis with ArcGIS Pro might require specific data formats and directory structures. Refer to the comments and code within the notebooks for detailed instructions.
